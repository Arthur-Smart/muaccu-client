                <p>This can be translated to mean purity. Chastity being the state of refraining from extramarital and sexual intercourse as a Christian Union we have always tried to engage this campaign so that we may all be educated on the same. Sexual immorality being the greatest challenge of most youths today. We try to overcome this by handling topics on Chastity and with the help of Focus staff find a very resourceful person who can address us on the same. We have had chastity campaings, chastity awarenessto bring people to the knoeledge of the importance of purity while not married</p>

                <p className='font-medium text-xl text-slate-500' >Prayer and fasting week</p>
                <p>As a church and a union, we are deeply rooted and grounded with roots of prayer. It has been a good discipline that has been cultivated and we thamk the Almighty that our members are still growing in it. Not to forget the prayer and fasting weeks that we always have on every First week of every month. Is is good that the members have embraced this and we are playing for deeper Dimensions in the spirit. Weekly prayer are also a good platform for our members to grow. Corporate prayers have assisted us alot in this just as the sword of the Spirit says that iron sharpens iron so do persons sharpen each other. The powerful morning glories have been an encouragement when we really command our day in the morning and indeed we have witnessed of the Lord's doing. We are looking to a time that we shall have vigilant intercessors in the church and that each and every person shall be found Vigilant seeking God.</p>
