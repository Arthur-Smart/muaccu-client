                <p>Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and lifted be his Holy name. We thank God and Bless His name for his goodness upon our church which he has raised to this place that we are at now. I take this opportunity to welcome us all to this fellowship where we are a union of believers from all walks of life. Our goal as a fellowship is to raise a generation that is rich in the word of God and a generation of men and women who pray and are intentional in the things of the Kingdom. In this fellowship we partner with God to see to it that we are renewed and transformed by the Word of God.
                    Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and lifted be his Holy name.
