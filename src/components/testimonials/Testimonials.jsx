                <p>Themed on 'Unity inChrist', MUACCU hosts a diverse of people based on their religious beliefs, different cultural behavour and also different church denominations. The fellowship in MUACCU is contagious, heart-touching and life changing. No one needs to attend the service twice to testify of the goodness of the LORD in fellowship.</p>
